    h1 The Company
    p We are Quoralis, a startup from Auckland, New Zealand, created as part of the C-Prize challenge in 2017. We are actively developing FallCast, a wearable solution which aims to prevent falls in our older population so that they may enjoy their golden years for longer.

    p &ldquo;As a kid I was always the one taking various objects or toys apart, finding out how they worked and much to the dismay of my parents, forgetting to put them back together. Today, I retain that curiosity and fascination from my childhood. It is no surprise then, that my passion lies in building both hardware and software solutions.
    
    p &ldquo;My experience in software development lies in the medical field. This has exposed me to many of the processes for getting a medical device to the market and an understanding of just how important it is to build the right product. My hobbyist hardware projects have given me the experience necessary to bridge the gap between software and hardware solutions. I see Fallcast as an opportunity to combine my hardware and software roles and to provide a technology solution that will improve people's lives.&rdquo;</p>

    p &ldquo;I am a designer with a focus on UX and UI (user experience &amp; user interface) and Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for new technology, gadgets and how they can change the way you go through your day. I can help the team accomplish their goals by providing the customer with a great experience.
    
    p &ldquo;I have experience with web and mobile development, which will speed the design process along by speaking a similar technical language. My experience integrating mobile applications with medical devices has provided me with insight into the benefits of medical technology innovation and how a product like FallCast can enrich the lifestyle of technology users.&rdquo;
